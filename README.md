**RUSTED DRAWER**

I DON'T KNOW RUST, but I would like to leatn something about.

Plus, I need a GUI to launch the applications I keep in my Python virtual environment, my scripts, and so on.

Till now, I have been using a launcher I wrote, based on bash and zenity, but now I'd like to learn something else.

If you have suggestions or ideas, please let me know.
